I am a PhD student at the Department of Mathematics at Dartmouth College. My research focuses on **enumerative combinatorics** and other areas of discrete mathematics.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Mathematics from UPC in May 2024 and Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and in Physics Engineering from UPC in May 2023 as part of the [CFIS](https://cfis.upc.edu/ca) program.
